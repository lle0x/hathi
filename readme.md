Welcome to Hathi, a filesharing client based on the eDonkey2000(C) network.

Even when we imported the project from SourceForge, Github's "import project" feature still sucks and most of commit history wasn't imported correctly.

Please visit us at http://hathi.sourceforge.net if you are interested in review our commits.

Please remember that this is an early version, not all features are implemented yet,
and not everything might work as expected.

You will need Visual Studio Express 2008 or the .NET Framework 2.0 SDK to compile Hathi. 
If you are interested in compile it under MONO or DOTGNU you can work in this task and 
let me know. We will include your changes in the next official release.

You can also compile Hathi with SharpDevelop and .NET framework 2.0 SDK.
